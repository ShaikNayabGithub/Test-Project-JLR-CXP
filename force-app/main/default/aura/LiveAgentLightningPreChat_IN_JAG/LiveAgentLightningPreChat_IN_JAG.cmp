                                We maintain dialogue transcripts of these chats. After the chat, we ask Jaguar Live Help customers to fill out an exit survey in order to obtain valuable feedback about the levels of our service. Moreover, all personal data is only collected if you voluntarily supply it, e.g. when completing a contact form. If during the live engagement the individual chooses to enter personal or business data (email addresses, names, addresses), the disclosure of such data is done so by the user on a voluntary basis. Such information is not passed to any third parties or used for any other purpose(s) than that/those requested by the customer. We log browser information (e.g. Internet Protocol addresses and browser types) to help diagnose problems with our service, gather broad demographic information and administer our site.
                                By choosing to engage in a chat and use the services, the user consents to such logging and processing of IP address.</p>
